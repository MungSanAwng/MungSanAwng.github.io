				<h4>My Admire Person</h4>
				<br>
				<p>Eiichiro Oda was born on January 1, 1975, in Kumamoto, Japan. He said that at the age of four he resolved to become a manga artist in order to avoid having to get a "real job".His biggest influence is Akira Toriyama and his series Dragon Ball. He recalls that his interest in pirates was probably sparked by the popular TV animation series titled Vicky the Viking. And he created One Piece in 1999 and it became one of the best selling manga. I like him because of his art, one piece, it make me not to give up and keep going on in life. </p>
